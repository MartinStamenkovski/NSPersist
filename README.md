# NSPersist

A simple lightweight Core Data wrapper in Swift.

I created this wrapper mostly to ease my workflow in the projects, if you find it useful feel free to use it and modify it to your needs.

### Currently NSPersist supports:
- [x] Delete. 
- [x] DeleteBatchAsync
- [x] UpdateBatchAsync
- [x] InsertBatchAsync
- [x] getAsync
- [x] get
- [x] UndoManager (iOS), macOS has one by default.
- [x] LightWeight migrations.
- [ ] CloudKit
